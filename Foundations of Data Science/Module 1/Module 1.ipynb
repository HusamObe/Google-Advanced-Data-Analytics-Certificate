    "## Data science vs. Data analytics\n",
    "* **Data science** is an entire field dedicated to making data more useful. A data scientist is a professional that uses raw data to develop new ways to model data and understand the unknown. Often, their job responsibilities incorporate various components of computer science, predictive analytics, statistics, and machine learning. The collections of information that data scientists work with can be quite large, requiring expertise to organize and navigate.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Data analytics** is a subfield of the larger data science discipline. The aim of data analytics is to create methods to capture, process, and organize data to uncover actionable insights for current problems. Analysts focus on processing the information stored in existing datasets and establishing the best way to present this data. Data analysts rely on statistics and data modeling to solve problems and offer recommendations that can lead to immediate improvements. \n"

    "- Data science and data analytics share a fundamental goal: discover insights that can be used to lead an organization to improve and grow. They are closely connected with information gathered through interactions within the measurable world. As data projects become more complicated, organizations are discovering the advantages of assembling data teams, bringing data analysts and data scientists together. Within these highly-collaborative working environments, data scientists and data analysts work on common tasks using similar software packages, tools, and programming languages. Additionally, the responsibilities of data scientists and data analysts are impacted by a company’s resources, budgetary constraints, and other factors which vary depending on the organization and industry. The commonalities between data science and data analytics within the workplace explain why practitioners and industry professionals often use the two titles interchangeably. This has also extended to job postings. "
